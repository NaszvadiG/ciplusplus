###CodeIgniter++

Note: This is still being committed, do not consider it done or usable yet. The blog post will be live once the project
is done.

####What?
[Blog post](http://www.bitfalls.com/2013/01/ci-codeigniter-with-html5-boilerplate.html) (coming soon) goes into detail on what and why.

####Requirements
Make sure you have mod_rewrite installed for routing. Other than that, you're golden if you're above php 5.3.

####Installation
Just download the zip, point a vhost to the /public subfolder with mod_rewrite on and start hacking.

####License
See LICENSE.md

####Contributing
If someone wants to keep this up to date, let me know. I probably won't be updating it further.

####Contact
